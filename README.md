A List of potential projects, to fill my CPs for CTech I / II


# My Interests

## Technology

* Procedural/Automated/Programmed Workflows
* Algorithms and their Effects and Invention of my own Algorithms
* Complex Systems: Many interacting Algorithms and Software / Hardware components
* Computational Linguistics: Programming Languages, Paradigm, "Methodology of Code Expression" and code literacy, Software development methodology
* Meta programming: Programming Programming Languages, Develop Development Environments
  * Example: Testing => Programs that test Programs, Build Process => Code that produces or changes other Code, Racket => Programming Programming Languages via Domain Specific      Languages
* Artificial Intelligience, especially GANs
* Shader Programming
* Physical Computing, with focus on mechanical controls
* Hacking: Entering a technical system and repurpose them against their intended function without using the intended interface or entry point. 


## Artistic/Film Interests

* Emergence => How a certain amount of rules or components leads to new compound behavior through their interaction
* Animation => Procedural Animation
* Storytelling, Plot Structure, Logic of Action
* Music Composition
* Video Game Mechanics
* Symbolism


### Intro 

I understand C-Tech as the intersection of Artistic Practice and Development. Not exclusively related to Film. On one side we have the Artistic which is enhanced by the Technological, this results in an instrumentalisation for the Artistic Practice through programming and technology. On the other side we have Technological Aspects enhanced by the Artistic, this results in the artistification of Computer Science, explore Technologies and Programming outside of their traditional boundaries, reflect on Code as a cultural product and instrument and how it can be used to explore new forms of expression. 

I am equally interested in both sides of Creative Technologies and I will try to explore them in different projects for CTech II.

# New Project Ideas

## Programming Layered Musical Compositions

The user can change motiv, phrase, sentences, sections separately. Instead of composing the song note by note, the development of composition components is expressed through an algorithm that the user can manipulate in a very intuitive user-interface. This is developed in Racket in which programs are built by first developing a very specific syntax or language to express a range of problems that are part of a domain. In this case musical composition. 


## Procedural Storytelling

The TV Show Dark and the Movie Tenet, or the Movie Memento have a very strong impact through complex Storytelling Techniques using interconnectedness and juxtaposition of time. If we understand a traditional Plot as the linear development of time, such films play with the perception of time to produce "confusing" plots as central selling point.
What I realized is that these kind of Plot-Structures (Nested Loops, Recursion, Forward/Reverse) could be described as algorithms. So the first part would be to find such plots and translate them into algorithms. As a second part a program could be developed that produces plots out of algorithms. 

## Artistic Question: How can Hacking become Art? 

Hacking is the exploitation of a technological system to use it against it's intended way. Could hacking be interpreted contrary to the cultural role as criminal activity as artistic practice. In the same vain as artistic movements such as dada, surrealism or conceptual art, where mundane objects have been repurposed or recontextualised to provoke or raise questions, can hardware and software be repurposed in a similar way?


## Artistic Question: How can I create a magic trick with technology in software by using classical practices like deception and illusion to fool perception?

Big Part of Modern Day Magic tricks is Deception and Misdirection. Often the Magician presents you with a plot or situation to draw your attention away from the actual "trick" exploiting a flaw in the human perception to create a sensation of disbelief. The core elements here are the "Trick" initself, the moment of Disbelief and the Illusion or Story to distract the perception of the user. How can these be explored and expressed through technology and programming?


## GAN To invent its own language and produce Calligraphic Posters out of them: Composition, Machine Learning, Calligraphy

Arabic and Asian Languages have very unique and argueably artistic calligraphy.
Can a GAN learn the nature of such written languages and produce it's own calligraphy.
And could this then be used in a second step to compose typographic posters out of them?

## Research a technical Paper (Procedural Animation) and implement it in different languages

Complex character animations is a very labor-intensive manual process with incredible results. In the past years there has been a trend to automate some of these processes. 
The first step would be to find technical papers about procedural animation techniques and a second step would be to implement the findings in one or multiple programming languages

## Arduino Mechanical programming: Artistic (Installation, Aesthetic, Playful) vs Functional (For Virtual Production or Scenography)

Software is invisible and abstract most of the time. Through physical computing it surfaces and interacts with the "real world". Through motorization software can have a real impact on physical objects. This could be explored in two directions. As a tool for production of films. Animated Requisites, Scene Component or Virtual production assistance. This however could also be explored artistically, by experimenting with movement and choreography and how to express it as contramption and code.

### Paper / Research into Virtual production, Scenography/Montage to find a problem that can be solved through creative use of technology

This could be a possible approach. To get a feeling for the State of the Art and find some problem to solve through physical computing

## Procedural Level Building for FPS: Spatial Design as Gameplay Component, Organize and Create Space programmatically, Translate Approach to Code

I am a big fan of Shooter Games. What fascinates me is how the layout of a level has a direct impact on the movement and the strategy of a player. Through the placement of geometry a certain spatial relationship of cover and opening is created that presents the players with creative situative problem solving through maneuvering. The meneuvering however has it's limits in levels with boundaries. If a player positions itself in a corner he reduces the chances for the opposition to flank him and cover vital strategic position. However, this also results in static gameplay. 
I want to design and implement a few game mechanics to remove these elements and promote dynamic movement driven gameplay inspired by paint ball matches. 

The First element would be to remove boundaries by implementing procedural generation of level to create theoretically infinite worlds. Then an objective needs to draw the action towards a focus area to increase the level of interaction between players. 

This is an interesting challenge of spatial design and programming.


## VR Parkour/Exploration Game: Lucido

When we dream we project past experiences and impressions into a disconnected world full of juxtapositions resulting in surreal experiences. Lucid dreamers are people who can affect the content and the storyline of their dreams. 
I want to develope a VR Game that simulates dreaming, by reassembling objects and meshes and transform it into a surreal landscape where a player can explore through parkouring and manipulating his dream. 

## (Maybe Artistic Piece through Sphere Casting (Shader))

If not covered by Lena's Shader workshop I would like to create an abstract complex procedural art work by means of Ray-Marching/Sphere casting

# Open / Unfinished Projects

## Saetta

Implement a small piece of a game. A Level concept, a simple low-poly character, a main game mechanic and game VFX in a very polished way and do so in the three Game Engines: Unreal Engine, Unity and Godot. To compare their strenght, what they offer out of the box, how their Architecture and Framework affects the Development process of the game.
As I wasn't aware of the necessity of CP through Ctech Projects, I have already done most of the work in my private time between the First and Second Semester and would like to evaluate it as a ctech project. A lot of work has to be done for Game VFX and final polish, aswell as find a suitable documentation format to present the findings.


## Flow

Roleplaying games are usually played by a group of players lead by a dungeon master. These require a lot of preparation and the players generally don't have much impact on the development of the world. With flow I want to change that by removing preemptive preparation time and giving every player equal amount of control, effectively removing the need for a DM. I developed a rule system based on balancing points to exchange control of the players to create events to develop their and other players plots. The plot creation and connection has been implemented as React and Express Webapp in a past project. I would like to develop it further, by implementing sessions and keeping track and separating players, characters and plot. 

## Vom Hauptplatz

I am helping Pedro with his final project, by providing him with technical problem solving, custom shaders and bug fixing. I also develop some VFX through simulation techniques such as particle systems.

## Full Contact: Maybe in connection with game design Freies Studium?
* How can character animation be used as central game mechanic for a fighting and sport game simultaneously?
