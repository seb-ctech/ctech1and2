# ctech1and2
A List of potential projects, to fill my CPs for CTech I / II


# My Interests

## Technology

* Procedural/Automated/Programmed Workflows
* Algorithms and their Effects and Invention of my own Algorithms
* Complex Systems: Many interacting Algorithms and Software / Hardware components
* Computational Linguistics: Programming Languages, Paradigm, "Methodology of Code Expression" and code literacy, Software development methodology
* Meta programming: Programming Programming Languages, Develop Development Environments
  * Example: Testing => Programs that test Programs, Build Process => Code that produces or changes other Code, Racket => Programming Programming Languages via Domain Specific      Languages
* Artificial Intelligience, especially GANs
* Shader Programming
* Physical Computing, with focus on mechanical controls
* Hacking: Entering a technical system and repurpose them against their intended function without using the intended interface or entry point. 


## Artistic/Film Interests

* Emergence => How a certain amount of rules or components leads to new compound behavior through their interaction
* Animation => Procedural Animation
* Storytelling, Plot Structure, Logic of Action
* Music Composition
* Video Game Mechanics
* Symbolism


### Intro 

I understand C-Tech as the intersection of Artistic Practice and Development. Not exclusively related to Film. On one side we have the Artistic which is enhanced by the Technological, this results in an instrumentalisation for the Artistic Practice through programming and technology. On the other side we have Technological Aspects enhanced by the Artistic, this results in the artistification of Computer Science, explore Technologies and Programming outside of their traditional boundaries, reflect on Code as a cultural product and instrument and how it can be used to explore new forms of expression. 

I am equally interested in both sides of Creative Technologies and I will try to explore them in different projects for CTech II.

# New Project Ideas

## Programming Musical Compositions: Racket DLs, Complex System, Layers of Complexity, Musical Composition, Express Change through algorithms

## Procedural Storytelling: Racket, Metaprogramming, Injection of Meaning to Structure, Storytelling / Plot structure

## Artistic Question: How can Hacking become Art? 

## Artistic Question: How can I create a magic trick with technology in software by using classical practices like deception and illusion to fool perception?

## GAN To invent its own language and produce Calligraphic Posters out of them: Composition, Machine Learning, Calligraphy

## Research a technical Paper (Procedural Animation) and implement it in different languages

## Arduino Mechanical programming: Artistic (Installation, Aesthetic, Playful) vs Functional (For Virtual Production or Scenography)

## Procedural Level Building for FPS: Spatial Design as Gameplay Component, Organize and Create Space programmatically, Translate Approach to Code

## Paper / Research into Virtual production, Scenography/Montage to find a problem that can be solved through creative use of technology

## VR Parkour/Exploration Game: Lucido

## (Maybe Artistic Piece through Sphere Casting (Shader))

# Open / Unfinished Projects

## Flow

## Saetta

## Vom Hauptplatz

## Full Contact: Maybe in connection with game design Freies Studium?
* How can character animation be used as central game mechanic for a fighting and sport game simultaneously?
